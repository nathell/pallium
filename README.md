# pallium

An ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow reimplementation of [Poliqarp][1] in Clojure.

Specifically, Pallium allows for reading Poliqarp corpora from within Clojure code. It’s currently low-level – it doesn’t support the Poliqarp query language – but I plan to use it to add support for Poliqarp corpora in [Smyrna][2] eventually.

## Why the name?

A pallium is an attribute of [St Polycarp of Smyrna][3].
